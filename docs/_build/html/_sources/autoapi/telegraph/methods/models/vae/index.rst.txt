.. py:class:: VAEDataset(X)

   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.utils.data.Dataset`


   An abstract class representing a :class:`Dataset`.

   All datasets that represent a map from keys to data samples should subclass
   it. All subclasses should overwrite :meth:`__getitem__`, supporting fetching a
   data sample for a given key. Subclasses could also optionally overwrite
   :meth:`__len__`, which is expected to return the size of the dataset by many
   :class:`~torch.utils.data.Sampler` implementations and the default options
   of :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. Subclasses could also
   optionally implement :meth:`__getitems__`, for speedup batched samples
   loading. This method accepts list of indices of samples of batch and returns
   list of samples.

   .. note::
     :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` by default constructs an index
     sampler that yields integral indices.  To make it work with a map-style
     dataset with non-integral indices/keys, a custom sampler must be provided.


   .. py:method:: __len__()


   .. py:method:: __getitem__(idx)


.. py:class:: VAE(input_dim, hidden_dim, z_dim, dropout: float = 0.2)

   Bases: :py:obj:`lightning.LightningModule`


   Base class for all neural network modules.

   Your models should also subclass this class.

   Modules can also contain other Modules, allowing to nest them in
   a tree structure. You can assign the submodules as regular attributes::

       import torch.nn as nn
       import torch.nn.functional as F

       class Model(nn.Module):
           def __init__(self):
               super().__init__()
               self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 20, 5)
               self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(20, 20, 5)

           def forward(self, x):
               x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
               return F.relu(self.conv2(x))

   Submodules assigned in this way will be registered, and will have their
   parameters converted too when you call :meth:`to`, etc.

   .. note::
       As per the example above, an ``__init__()`` call to the parent class
       must be made before assignment on the child.

   :ivar training: Boolean represents whether this module is in training or
                   evaluation mode.
   :vartype training: bool


   .. py:method:: encode(x)


   .. py:method:: reparameterize(mu, log_var)


   .. py:method:: decode(z)


   .. py:method:: forward(x)

      Same as :meth:`torch.nn.Module.forward`.

      :param \*args: Whatever you decide to pass into the forward method.
      :param \*\*kwargs: Keyword arguments are also possible.

      :returns: Your model's output



   .. py:method:: loss(x, x_pred, mu, log_var)


   .. py:method:: _step(batch, batch_idx)


   .. py:method:: training_step(batch, batch_idx)

      Here you compute and return the training loss and some additional metrics for e.g. the progress bar or
      logger.

      :param batch: The output of your data iterable, normally a :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader`.
      :param batch_idx: The index of this batch.
      :param dataloader_idx: The index of the dataloader that produced this batch.
                             (only if multiple dataloaders used)

      :returns:

                - :class:`~torch.Tensor` - The loss tensor
                - ``dict`` - A dictionary. Can include any keys, but must include the key ``'loss'``.
                - ``None`` - Skip to the next batch. This is only supported for automatic optimization.
                    This is not supported for multi-GPU, TPU, IPU, or DeepSpeed.

      In this step you'd normally do the forward pass and calculate the loss for a batch.
      You can also do fancier things like multiple forward passes or something model specific.

      Example::

          def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
              x, y, z = batch
              out = self.encoder(x)
              loss = self.loss(out, x)
              return loss

      To use multiple optimizers, you can switch to 'manual optimization' and control their stepping:

      .. code-block:: python

          def __init__(self):
              super().__init__()
              self.automatic_optimization = False


          # Multiple optimizers (e.g.: GANs)
          def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
              opt1, opt2 = self.optimizers()

              # do training_step with encoder
              ...
              opt1.step()
              # do training_step with decoder
              ...
              opt2.step()

      .. note::

         When ``accumulate_grad_batches`` > 1, the loss returned here will be automatically
         normalized by ``accumulate_grad_batches`` internally.



   .. py:method:: training_step(batch, batch_idx)

      Here you compute and return the training loss and some additional metrics for e.g. the progress bar or
      logger.

      :param batch: The output of your data iterable, normally a :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader`.
      :param batch_idx: The index of this batch.
      :param dataloader_idx: The index of the dataloader that produced this batch.
                             (only if multiple dataloaders used)

      :returns:

                - :class:`~torch.Tensor` - The loss tensor
                - ``dict`` - A dictionary. Can include any keys, but must include the key ``'loss'``.
                - ``None`` - Skip to the next batch. This is only supported for automatic optimization.
                    This is not supported for multi-GPU, TPU, IPU, or DeepSpeed.

              out = self.encoder(x)
              loss = self.loss(out, x)
              return loss

          # Multiple optimizers (e.g.: GANs)
          def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
              opt1, opt2 = self.optimizers()

              # do training_step with encoder
              ...
              opt1.step()
              # do training_step with decoder
              ...
              opt2.step()

      .. note::

         normalized by ``accumulate_grad_batches`` internally.



   .. py:method:: configure_optimizers()

      Choose what optimizers and learning-rate schedulers to use in your optimization. Normally you'd need one.
      But in the case of GANs or similar you might have multiple. Optimization with multiple optimizers only works in
      the manual optimization mode.

      :returns: Any of these 6 options.

                - **Single optimizer**.
                - **List or Tuple** of optimizers.
                - **Two lists** - The first list has multiple optimizers, and the second has multiple LR schedulers
                  (or multiple ``lr_scheduler_config``).
                - **Dictionary**, with an ``"optimizer"`` key, and (optionally) a ``"lr_scheduler"``
                  key whose value is a single LR scheduler or ``lr_scheduler_config``.
                - **None** - Fit will run without any optimizer.

      The ``lr_scheduler_config`` is a dictionary which contains the scheduler and its associated configuration.
      The default configuration is shown below.

      .. code-block:: python

          lr_scheduler_config = {
              # REQUIRED: The scheduler instance
              "scheduler": lr_scheduler,
              # The unit of the scheduler's step size, could also be 'step'.
              # 'epoch' updates the scheduler on epoch end whereas 'step'
              # updates it after a optimizer update.
              "interval": "epoch",
              # How many epochs/steps should pass between calls to
              # `scheduler.step()`. 1 corresponds to updating the learning
              # rate after every epoch/step.
              "frequency": 1,
              # Metric to to monitor for schedulers like `ReduceLROnPlateau`
              "monitor": "val_loss",
              # If set to `True`, will enforce that the value specified 'monitor'
              # is available when the scheduler is updated, thus stopping
              # training if not found. If set to `False`, it will only produce a warning
              "strict": True,
              # If using the `LearningRateMonitor` callback to monitor the
              # learning rate progress, this keyword can be used to specify
              # a custom logged name
              "name": None,
          }

      When there are schedulers in which the ``.step()`` method is conditioned on a value, such as the
      :class:`torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler, Lightning requires that the
      ``lr_scheduler_config`` contains the keyword ``"monitor"`` set to the metric name that the scheduler
      should be conditioned on.

      .. testcode::

          # The ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler requires a monitor
          def configure_optimizers(self):
              optimizer = Adam(...)
              return {
                  "optimizer": optimizer,
                  "lr_scheduler": {
                      "scheduler": ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, ...),
                      "monitor": "metric_to_track",
                      "frequency": "indicates how often the metric is updated"
                      # If "monitor" references validation metrics, then "frequency" should be set to a
                      # multiple of "trainer.check_val_every_n_epoch".
                  },
              }


          # In the case of two optimizers, only one using the ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler
          def configure_optimizers(self):
              optimizer1 = Adam(...)
              optimizer2 = SGD(...)
              scheduler1 = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer1, ...)
              scheduler2 = LambdaLR(optimizer2, ...)
              return (
                  {
                      "optimizer": optimizer1,
                      "lr_scheduler": {
                          "scheduler": scheduler1,
                          "monitor": "metric_to_track",
                      },
                  },
                  {"optimizer": optimizer2, "lr_scheduler": scheduler2},
              )

      Metrics can be made available to monitor by simply logging it using
      ``self.log('metric_to_track', metric_val)`` in your :class:`~lightning.pytorch.core.LightningModule`.

      .. note::

         Some things to know:

         - Lightning calls ``.backward()`` and ``.step()`` automatically in case of automatic optimization.
         - If a learning rate scheduler is specified in ``configure_optimizers()`` with key
           ``"interval"`` (default "epoch") in the scheduler configuration, Lightning will call
           the scheduler's ``.step()`` method automatically in case of automatic optimization.
         - If you use 16-bit precision (``precision=16``), Lightning will automatically handle the optimizer.
         - If you use :class:`torch.optim.LBFGS`, Lightning handles the closure function automatically for you.
         - If you use multiple optimizers, you will have to switch to 'manual optimization' mode and step them
           yourself.
         - If you need to control how often the optimizer steps, override the :meth:`optimizer_step` hook.
